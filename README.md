Repository for a project of the exam "Control of Communications and Energy Networks" at La Sapienza University. Aim of the project is showcasing the capabilities of genetic algorithms as general purpose nonlinear solvers.

A flappy bird clone developed by  @sourabhv (https://github.com/sourabhv) was chosen as an example problem. The algorithms were developed to solve a version of the game in which the pipes are fixed at all times.
